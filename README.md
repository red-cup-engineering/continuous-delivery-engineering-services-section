# continuous-delivery-services-section

The one hired CI/CD section. Repos do not hand-write CI; they call these workflows.
Public so private repos in any org can call it. Callers pay their own minutes and use their own secrets.

Caller snippet (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

```yaml
name: ci
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  ci:
    uses: red-cup-engineering/continuous-delivery-services-section/.github/workflows/node-package.yml@main
```

Workflows (swap the file name):

- `node-package.yml` - every package.json: `npm ci`, `check`, `test` on Node 24. Inputs: `paths` (JSON array), `concurrency`.
- `lean.yml` - lake build. Input: `working-directory`.
- `submodule-advance.yml` - one PR bumping moved submodule heads. Secret: `token` (needs `secrets: inherit` or `secrets: {token: ...}`). Schedule it with `on: schedule`.
- `content.yml` - JSON files with a relative `$schema` are validated; relative markdown links are checked. Input: `links`.

Lean with a directory:

```yaml
jobs:
  ci:
    uses: red-cup-engineering/continuous-delivery-services-section/.github/workflows/lean.yml@main
    with: { working-directory: . }
```
